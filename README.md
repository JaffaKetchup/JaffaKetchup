### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I develop modern and functional applications and open-source libraries with Flutter & Dart, including Flutter's â„–1 non-commercially aimed map client, flutter_map. I've also worked as a software engineer to build a social media app from scratch, and regualarly contribute to a number of other projects.

Feel free to call me Jaffa :)
