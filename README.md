### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently in full-time education in the UK studying Computer Science, Geography, and Mathematics, and have been building my software development skills alongside my education for many years. I specialise in the Flutter and Dart technologies to build cross-platform applications, and have over 4 years of experience both from a hobby and commercial standpoint.

I've worked as a senior developer with a small team at WatchEnterprise to develop their Flutter-based WatchCrunch social media app for Android & iOS.

I'm one of a small team of maintainers for Flutter's â„–1 non-commercially aimed mapping library 'flutter_map', for which we make internal contributions, regulate and collaborate with external contributors, and offer support to a large community. I also personally develop a multitude of extension libraries, such as 'flutter_map_tile_caching'. In addition, I regularly contribute to OpenStreetMap, and continously improve my skills with personal experimental projects.

I'm eager to earn other languages, and more than happy to talk about anything software development related!
