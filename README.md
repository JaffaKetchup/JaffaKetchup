### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luka, but I prefer to go by JaffaKetchup! I'm an under-18 currently living in the UK, and I am in full-time education. I enjoy programming with Dart and Flutter, although I occasionally play around with other technologies such as Firebase and languages such as JavaScript.

I work on all of my projects in my spare time, including maintaining (along with a team) Flutter's number 1 (non-commercially maintained) mapping library ['flutter_map'](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map), bringing it back from the brink of abandonment, as well as my own plugin for it (['flutter_map_tile_caching'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching)) that extends it with advanced caching and downloading.

Additionally, I also own the Dart encoder/decoder for the [QOI image format](https://qoiformat.org/) ([dqoi](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/dqoi)) - and I am slowly working on ['flutter_osrm'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_osrm), a wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine.
