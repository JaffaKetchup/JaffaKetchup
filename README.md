### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luka, but I prefer to go by JaffaKetchup!

I'm currently in full-time education, living in the UK. I have 4+ years experience working with the Flutter and Dart cross platform technologies, both within open-source projects (both small & large) and as a senior developer for WatchCrunch, where I worked on a new Android & iOS app.

In my spare time, I contribute to a variety of open-source projects.  
I maintain Flutter's â„–1 non-commercially aimed mapping library ['flutter_map'](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map), having helped bring it back from the brink of extinction with a small team of maintainers.  
Along with this, I own and maintain one of its most popular extension plugins (['flutter_map_tile_caching'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching)), that extends it with advanced behaviours for offline mapping.  
In addition to those, I also own a Dart encoder/decoder for the [QOI image format](https://qoiformat.org/) (['dqoi'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/dqoi)) - and I am slowly working on ['flutter_osrm'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_osrm), a wrapper for the [Open Source Routing Machine](https://project-osrm.org/).
