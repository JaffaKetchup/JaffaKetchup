### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luka, but I go by [Jaffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Cakes)[Ketchup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup)!

I'm currently in full-time education, living in the UK. I have 4+ years experience working with the Flutter and Dart cross platform technologies, both within open-source projects (both small & large) and as a senior developer for WatchCrunch, where I worked on a new Android & iOS app.

In my spare time, I contribute to a variety of open-source projects. From maintaining Flutter's â„–1 non-commercially aimed mapping library '[flutter_map](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map)' and developing plugins for it such as '[flutter_map_tile_caching](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching)' which extends it with advanced offline functionality & '[flutter_osrm](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_osrm)' which extends it with routing via OSRM, to porting useful (but niche) libraries '[dart_earcut](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/dart_earcut)' & '[dqoi](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/dqoi)', I invest a lot of time and money developing FOSS projects for all to use. I also develop my skills with personal experimental projects, in Dart, Python, and JavaScript.
